# Provably Random Raffle Contracts

## About
This project demonstrates a provably random smart contract lottery utilizing Chainlink VRF and Automation.

## What we want it to do?

1. Users can enter by paying for a ticket
- The ticket fees are going to go to the winner during the draw
2. After X period of time, the lottery will automatically draw a winner
- And this will be done programatically
3. Using Chainlink VRF & Chainlink Automation
- Chainlink VRF => Randomness
- Chainlink Automation => Time based trigger
